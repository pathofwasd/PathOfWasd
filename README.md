# Path of WASD

**Path of WASD** is a WPF-based overlay application that enables **WASD movement** in *Path of Exile (PoE)*. This is an early release aimed at getting feedback from the community. The tool is primarily for players who want a more traditional action RPG control scheme using keyboard movement.

> ⚠️ This is an experimental build. Expect bugs and unpolished behavior.

---

## 🔧 What It Does

- Enables **WASD movement** in Path of Exile (tested on PoE 3.26).
- Runs as a transparent overlay using WPF.
- Offers a minimal settings UI to customize keybindings and modes.
- Supports mouse-based aiming alongside keyboard movement.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Windows 10 or newer
- [.NET 6 or later runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) installed (if not using the self-contained version)
- Path of Exile installed (Steam or standalone)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download the latest `.exe` file from the [Releases](../../releases) tab.
2. Run the application. (It does **not** require installation.)
3. Launch Path of Exile.
4. Use the settings menu to bind movement keys and toggle overlay options.

> 🧩 First-time setup might require running the app as Administrator to ensure overlay functionality.

---

## 📢 Status

- This is the **first public build**, uploaded immediately after initial development.
- It has **not been tested** on any machine other than the developer's.
- Expect bugs, crashes, or unexpected behavior.
- Performance and compatibility optimizations will come later.

## 📖 Documentation & Support
## Instructions (More tutorials coming soon)

- Full instructions and tutorials will be added soon.

### Custom Cursor

- You can replace the cursor by placing a file at:  
  `AppData\Local\PathOfWASD`  
  Example: `C:\Users\someuser\AppData\Local\PathOfWASD`

- **IMPORTANT:**  
  If you add a custom cursor:
  - The file name **must be** `cursor.png`
  - It **must be a PNG file**
  - You **must delete** or replace the old one

---

### Midpoint

- The *Midpoint* is the center of your screen with a slight offset — the "middle" of your character in Path of Exile is slightly below the true screen center (at least on my monitor).
- If the calculated midpoint seems off, you can manually set your own.
- The midpoint determines the origin for your WASD movement — if it's not centered well, pressing A or D may cause a slight upward/downward drift.

---

### Movement Offset

- *Movement Offset* controls how far the mouse travels and clicks when pressing W, A, S, or D.
- A value of `100` worked well for my monitor, but it may vary for yours.
- A higher offset = further distance traveled with each tap.
- Generally, you want the **lowest value** that still allows smooth movement while holding WASD.

---

### Hold Toggle WASD Mode

- This is actually a really important keybind. By default, it's set to a weird key (I use Scroll Lock bound to a custom mouse button), but **you’ll want to change it to something you can press easily**.

- This key temporarily **disables WASD mode while held**, then **re-enables it when released**.  
  It’s essential for quickly exiting WASD mode to pick up loot, interact with the UI, or perform other actions with your real cursor.

- For longer actions, you can still use the full **Toggle Off** option, but this hold-toggle is ideal for brief interruptions.

---

### Delays (Advanced)

- These settings help smooth the interaction between movement and using skills.
- I’ll provide a full tutorial soon, but here’s a basic explanation:

#### After Mouse Jump Delay
- Adds a delay **before** the real mouse (hidden) is teleported to the virtual mouse.
- This lets the skill cast from the real mouse’s position (near center) **before** snapping to the virtual one (your cursor target).

#### Before Move Delay
- Adds a delay **after** casting a skill **before** movement resumes via WASD.
- Helps avoid interrupting skill animations by moving too early.

- Different skills may require different timing. Eventually, I want to allow **per-skill custom delays**.
- For now:
  - **Option 1:** No delay (hold each skill key until it activates).
  - **Option 2:** Use a universal delay — I found `100ms` works well.

---

### Key Bindings

- **Movement Key:**  
  The key your *Walk* or *Move* skill is bound to on your skill bar.

- **Stand Key:**  
  The key in Path of Exile's game settings that stops movement while attacking.

### 💡 Tips

- You may notice that many of the default keybinds — aside from the main skill keys — are set to keys that don’t have much of an effect when pressed or held down normally, like Scroll lock or the F keys.  
  This was intentional.

- Feel free to change the keybinds to whatever works best for you, but the more you use **passive keys** (keys that don’t do much outside the program or game), the more likely the app will run smoothly 24/7 without issues or annoyances.

- There may still be a few bugs with keys getting "stuck" down. I did my best to fix these, but some might have slipped through.

## 📝 Notes

- ⚠️ **Not affiliated with or endorsed by Grinding Gear Games.**

- ⚙️ **Use at your own risk.**  
  This app does **not** modify game files or memory, but like any overlay or tool that performs semi-automated clicks, caution is advised.

- 🧪 **Limited Testing:**  
  I haven’t had much time to test this. If you do weird things or try to break the app, it will probably break.

- 🧼 **Code Quality & Open Source Plans:**  
  I’ll open-source the project eventually. The code is a rushed mess — it’s my first WPF app. I’ve done a lot of refactoring, but there’s more to do.

- 📨 **Want the code early?**  
  If I haven’t uploaded it yet and it’s been a while, feel free to message me on Discord. I’ll release it manually if needed.

- 🔒 **Why the delay on source release?**  
  Just in case GGG ends up disliking the app and asks for a takedown, I can remove the repo and reduce the chance of signature detection on current builds.  
  (This is probably unlikely, but I’ve already received a lot of hate from some PoE players — so again, **use at your own risk**.)

- 🤷 **Not revolutionary tech:**  
  It was a bit of a pain to make, but not too bad. If the idea becomes popular, someone else will likely create their own version — which might help keep GGG more relaxed about this.

- 🐛 **If it blows up and bugs pile up...**  
  I might not have time to fix everything. If that happens, I’ll just open-source it. Screw it — lol.

- 🎮 **Controller Support Idea:**  
  I’d *love* for someone to take this concept and make it work for controllers. My code could help, but it needs to be cleaned up first to be usable by a community.

- ❓ **Need Help?**  
  Some settings might not be self-explanatory. If you're confused, message me on Discord. I’ll try to post a full tutorial this weekend — I just have a lot of work.  
  **Enjoy!**


## 💡 Future Plans

Stay tuned, and thanks for helping test **Path of WASD**!
