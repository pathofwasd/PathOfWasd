# Path of WASD

**Path of WASD** is a WPF-based overlay application that enables **WASD movement** in *Path of Exile (PoE)*. This is an early release aimed at getting feedback from the community. The tool is primarily for players who want a more traditional action RPG control scheme using keyboard movement.

> ⚠️ This is an experimental build. Expect bugs and unpolished behavior.
