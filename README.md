# Path of WASD

**Path of WASD** is a WPF-based overlay application that enables **WASD movement** in *Path of Exile (PoE)*. This is an early release aimed at getting feedback from the community. The tool is primarily for players who want a more traditional action RPG control scheme using keyboard movement.

> ⚠️ This is an experimental build. Expect bugs and unpolished behavior.

---

## 🔧 What It Does

- Enables **WASD movement** in Path of Exile (tested on PoE 3.26).
- Runs as a transparent overlay using WPF.
- Offers a minimal settings UI to customize keybindings and modes.
- Supports mouse-based aiming alongside keyboard movement.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Windows 10 or newer
- [.NET 6 or later runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) installed (if not using the self-contained version)
- Path of Exile installed (Steam or standalone)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download the latest `.exe` file from the [Releases](../../releases) tab.
2. Run the application. (It does **not** require installation.)
3. Launch Path of Exile.
4. Use the settings menu to bind movement keys and toggle overlay options.

> 🧩 First-time setup might require running the app as Administrator to ensure overlay functionality.

## 📢 Status

- This is the **first public build**, uploaded immediately after initial development.
- It has **not been tested** on any machine other than the developer's.
- Expect bugs, crashes, or unexpected behavior.
- Performance and compatibility optimizations will come later.

---

## 📖 Documentation & Support

- Full instructions and tutorials will be added soon.
- AppData\Local\PathOfWASD you can replace the cursor here if you want.
- Midpoint is the middle of your screen with a slight offset, as the "middle" of your character in POE is slightly under the screens true middle (atleast for my monitor?).
- But in the case your programs calculated midpoint is wack, you can set your own midpoint.
- Your midpoint is what will dictate your movement locations while pressing WASD, if it is not centered well, A and D may drift slightly up or down. 
- For now, you can:
  - 🛠 Submit a bug or issue [here on GitHub](../../issues)
  - 💬 Contact me directly on Discord: `bingtar`

## 📝 Notes

- This app is *not affiliated with or endorsed by Grinding Gear Games*.
- Use at your own risk. It does not modify game files or memory, but as with any overlay tool and tool that semi does automated clicks, caution is advised.
- I have not had a lot of time to test this, so if you do weird things or try to break the app, it will likely break.
- Some settings may not be self explainitory, if you have questions, message me on discord, I will try to find time to post a tutorital this weekend. I have lots of work. Enjoy!
